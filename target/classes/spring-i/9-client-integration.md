# Client Integration 

For this part, we will simply go to our Movies Application client replace the URLs used in `fetch` calls with `http://localhost:8080/<your-route>`.

If you were calling out to `https://wub-dub-movie-boi.glitch.me/movies` for a `GET` request, all you need is to switch it to `http://localhost:8080/movies` for that same `GET` request.

We may run into CORS issues when using a browser such as Chrome or Firefox. That is ok and we will address them as they arise!

# Congrats!

You've made your first truly full-stack application!
